LinkCatcher handles links clicked from various applications (Outlook, Word, etc) by opening the link first in a window and then displaying the actual URL that is being sent to the browser (so far only supports Chrome).
You can then choose whether or not to continue opening the link.
up to 3 additional paramters are also displayed as plain text in new lines underneath the link.

To install, merge the .reg file to your registry and place LinkCatcher.exe into the C:\temp\trash\ directory (create it if it doesn't exist).
